Implement the following using pipes.The program receives two filenames as command line parameters.The parent process writes the contents of first file to the pipe and the child process reads from the pipe and writes into the second file. The contents which are copied into second file should be reversed.(For example: " I am funny" as "funny am I"). After recieving the contents from parent process ,the child process sends a signal "SIGCHLD" to the parent process .The parent process after receiving the signal closes the pipe and exits.
